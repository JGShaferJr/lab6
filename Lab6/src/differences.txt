The main difference between my code and the generated Umple code was the detail. The umple code was very
	well commented and the structure was very organized. The plugin could be useful for creating 
	the structure of a program abstractly. This would be a much faster method, and possibly less 
	error-proned, than writing all the code out by hand. I think this is a great tool once
	a user understands and feels comfortable using Umple.
